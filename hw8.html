        <h2>Explanation of AJAX</h2>
        <p>
            In the HTML file, you will notice some JavaScript code that uses AJAX.<br>
            AJAX, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, allows us to send and receive <br>
            data from a server without reloading the entire page. It makes web experiences more <br>
            dynamic and interactive by fetching data from the server in the background and <br>
            updating specific parts of the webpage with the received data.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's dive into the AJAX calls in the .html file. The code is making requests<br> 
            to a server to retrieve data in XML format. It does this by creating an XMLHttpRequest<br> 
            object, which is a commonly used tool for AJAX. The object is configured with the appropriate <br>
            URL to send a "GET" request to the server. Then, the code sets up an <br>
            event listener to handle the response asynchronously.<br>
        </p>
            
        <br>
